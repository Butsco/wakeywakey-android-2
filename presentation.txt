Is everybody still awake? Getting tired huh. Imagine how you will feel tomorrow morning when that alarm clock is ringing... That snooze button will be really attractive to be pressed, right?


We are Bert and Maarten, we are from Belgium and created an android app to help you wake up tomorrow.
The app is called Wakey Wakey, it uses the Twillio api and will help you get out of bed in a cheerful way.

In our app you first pick the time to wake up.

Then you select a friend that will help you wake up.

How would you like to be waken up? Want your friend to sing a song, tell a joke or maybe wish you succes for your big day?

Now the alarm is set and Maarten will receive ans sms and a call with Twilio at the wake-up time. When he picks up my phone will start ringing and Maarten can wake me up in a cheerful. Sooo much better than that snooze button :)

SO the technology we used: Twilio, node.js, elastic beanstalk and android.
